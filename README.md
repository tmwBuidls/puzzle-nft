# Puzzle NFT Project

An Ethereum smart contract that encourages users to collect puzzle pieces from different puzzles and then claim the final puzzle once they have collected them all.

Built using hardhat and waffle. My first attempt at a proper smart contract beyond tutorials. Still a lot to do/ improve on, most of which I've commented on at the top of `Puzzle.sol`.

## Commands
