# TODO
- Re-implement ether payment and tests
- Test the baseURI and tokenURI logic
- Decide what owner functions I may want, e.g:
    - Change puzzle prices
    - Change token URIs and Base URI
    - Change max tokens per person/ reset it for future sales
    - Pause/ start sale
- Review visibility (private/ public etc)
- Review data considerations
- Solidity linting etc.
- Look into upgradeable contract
